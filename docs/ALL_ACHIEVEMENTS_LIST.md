## Achievement Permanence Analysis

### ✅ Deletion-Proof (40 achievements)

These are based on **actions taken** and cannot be lost:
- All Study achievements (tracked via FocusSession)
- All Streak achievements (tracked via UserProgress)
- All Mastery/Level achievements (XP never decreases)
- All completion-based achievements (tasks completed, cards reviewed, exams completed)
- All Social achievements (ActivityLog entries)
- All Profile achievements (permanent once earned)
- All time-based Special achievements

### ⚠️ Needs Cumulative Tracking (18 achievements)

These are currently based on **current counts** and may need cumulative counters:
- Notes: first-note, notes-10, notes-50, notes-100, notes-500
- Folders: first-folder, folder-master
- Tags: first-tag, tag-master
- Tasks: first-task (creation count)
- Decks: first-deck, deck-collector
- Exams: exam-creator
- Questions: question-master
- Note Links: first-link, knowledge-connector
- Mixed: well-rounded, power-user, variety-expert

**Solution**: Add cumulative counters to UserProgress model:
```prisma
model UserProgress {
  // ... existing fields
  totalNotesCreated      Int @default(0)
  totalFoldersCreated    Int @default(0)
  totalTagsCreated       Int @default(0)
  totalTasksCreated      Int @default(0)
  totalDecksCreated      Int @default(0)
  totalExamsCreated      Int @default(0)
  totalQuestionsCreated  Int @default(0)
  totalLinksCreated      Int @default(0)
}
```

Increment these on creation, never decrement on deletion.
