# Sound Effects for Gamification

This directory contains sound effects for the gamification system.

## Required Sound Files

Please add the following sound files to this directory:

### 1. achievement-unlock.mp3
- A celebratory sound effect that plays when a user unlocks an achievement
- Suggested: Chime, bell, or fanfare sound (0.5-2 seconds)
- Example sources:
  - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/achievement/
  - https://freesound.org/ (search "achievement" or "success")

### 2. level-up.mp3
- An uplifting sound effect that plays when a user levels up
- Suggested: Power-up, ascending chime, or victory fanfare (1-3 seconds)
- Example sources:
  - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/win/
  - https://freesound.org/ (search "level up" or "power up")

## Adding Sound Files

1. Download appropriate sound effects (ensure they are royalty-free or properly licensed)
2. Convert to MP3 format if needed
3. Place them in this directory with the exact filenames:
   - `achievement-unlock.mp3`
   - `level-up.mp3`

## Notes

- Sound files are optional - the modals will work without them (the audio will simply fail silently)
- Keep file sizes small for better performance (aim for < 100KB each)
- Ensure the sounds are pleasant and not too loud or jarring
